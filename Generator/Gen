Address Count -n
-Number of matching addresses to generate

Strings -s
-String(s) to look for

CPU Thread Count -c
-Number of cpu threads

Logging -l
-Logging
	If logging is string, append to that filename

Score Threshold -st
-Number for minimum score before return is accepted
	If score is 0, everything will pass

0 based Addresses -r0
-Multiplier to score per leading 0
	if not 0 then start of string is counted at first non 0 char and score of input is added per 0

Rare Addresses -ra
-Whether to immediately return rare address types
	Letters | Numbers
	Letter Addresses
	-Toggle for whether addresses comprised of only letters should be returned (will never happen)

	Number Addresses
	-Toggle for whether addresses comprised of only numbers should be returned

Search Location -sl
-Multiplier for where string is located within address
	start | middle | end
	if middle and end are 0, skip any address that doesn't match a string going in order
	Can be at start: -placement "1, 0, 0"
	Can be at start or end with preference for start: -placement "2, 0, 1"
	Can be anywhere with no preference: -placement "0, 1, 0"


Dynamic Score -ds
-Manual score entry after each string
	if false, assign 1 point per character

Similar Addresses -sa
	-Toggle for whether similar strings are looked for

Only applies for multi search
	Connection Method -cm
	-Toggle for whether connected strings increase score like 2 seperate strings or 1 long one

	Only applies if Connection Method == "1 long one"
		Connection Boundary -cb
		-Maximum number of chars for distance between strings for them to be "connected"


Architecture:

Run master

check if string contains more than one entry

check if string is using dynamic scores

validate string

check if string is going to use similars
	generate them

display a message to console with the amount of entries to check for

sort addresses alphanumerically

set variables
	check if score threshold is 0 (error if dynamic scores is active)


create workers based on number of threads and pass them these variables

wait for workers to send accounts back and add them to file until number of addresses is reached
	end
